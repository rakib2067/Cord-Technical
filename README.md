## Wins and Challenges

### Wins

- Managed to complete the task in line with the design mockups and required functionality
- Used styled components to make the app responsive
- Was able to implement knowledge gained about React, React router, and optimization hooks such as `useCallback`
- Was able to handle component wide state by passing and lifting state, as Context and Redux would be overextensive

## Challenges:

- First time using styled components and SASS (was not able to utilise SASS)
- Was not able to implement testing

## Process

- Started by checking all the imports and wrappers where valid
- Then checked for all routes and props where being passed correctly
- Checked the redux actions where working and being dispatched properly
- e.g: `useEffect(() => { dispatch(getResult("London")); }, []);`
